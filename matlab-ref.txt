Informal write-up for Matlab intoductory laboratory

Below is a compiled Quick Reference Guide to matlab. All info taken from
laboratory exercise.

-> Use a colon to specify a range of number, for example D = 1:5 creates a
vector with the numbers 1 through 5 (inclusive). You can also specify a
step value (G =1:2:10)

-> Remember these important points about Matlab:
   -> 1-based subscripts:  Forget about C/Java/Scheme for the time-being.
   -> Flexible subscripting:  Another array can be used as a subscript for
    multiple elements.
   -> Parentheses () not brackets [] are used for subscripts. Brackets [] 
   are used to construct arrays.

-> Matlab can do vector comparisons. (E<0)

-> The command: help function 
   displays some basic (and some times not-so-basic) information about 
   the command function in your command window. You can open the same (and
   more) information in an interactive help window by using the command 

-> use doc function to access documentation

-> to search for a keyword use "lookfor" command

-> arrayfun applies a function to the specified matrix. eg:
   anotherFunHandle =   @(x)log(abs(x)+1);
   B = arrayfun( anotherFunHandle, B ) % B already exists here

->> Recall that do do subtraction matricies must be same size!
-> use repmat to REPeat the MATrix across the rows of A. eg:
    Y = repmat(X,[m n ...]);              or use

-> sxfun, (Binary [operator] Singleton eXpansion) a function that can do
 the repetition implicitly if you specify the operation on a function handle.

--------------------------------Images-----------------------------------------
-> use imread to read in an image

-> if data values are unsigned, 8 bit integers than image out to be a unit8
   var

-> Display an image using imshow(I). imshow(Ir) Displays the image in the
 new window. 

-> Save a copy of your image using imwrite. note PNG are lossless

-> rgb2gray converts image to grayscale
